[Experimental Game Jams](https://experimentaljams.com)

Experimental Game Jams is about discovering completely new types of gameplay. Each month there is a new theme and users must create their game to match that theme. The rules are that each game must be made by 1 person and within 1 month, and the game must demonstrate a completely new type of gameplay never seen before.

[Tuxmino](https://github.com/masonarmand/tuxmino)

Tuxmino is a high difficulty falling block puzzle game. The goal of this project is to create a highly modifiable and extensible game. Currently working on adding Lua support for custom user-created game modes.
